'''
Abstract: This script provides functions to parse Cabrillo formatted logs for the 2024 CQ WW CW Contest. 
It includes functionality to check the Cabrillo format version, extract header information, and parse QSO logs. 
The script handles callsigns with special characters and ensures that only relevant categories are processed, excluding personal information. 
The parsed data can be used for further analysis or storage in structured formats like DataFrames.

functions:
- cabrillo_format_version_checker(callsign): Determines the Cabrillo format version of a
    given callsign's log file.
- header_parser(callsign, data_cats=categories_of_interest, exclude_cats=strings_to_exclude):
    Extracts and returns header information from a callsign's log file, focusing on specified categories.
- log_parser(callsign, log_headers=QSO_log_headers): 
    Parses the QSO log entries from a callsign's log file and returns them as a list of dictionaries.
